- User authentication and authorization with role-based access control
- Product and category management
- Order processing with status tracking
- Secure password handling with BCrypt
- RESTful API endpoints for all operations
- MySQL database integration

## Architecture
The system is built on a microservices architecture with three main services:
- User Service: Handles user management and authentication
- Order Service: Manages order processing and tracking
- Category & Product Service: Handles product and category management

Each microservice operates independently with its own database while communicating through RESTful APIs.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Security:** Spring Security, BCrypt Password Encoding
- **Development Tools:**
  - Version Control: Git, GitHub
  - Database Tools: DBeaver, DataGrip
  - API Testing: Postman, H2 Database
  - Build Tool: Maven
